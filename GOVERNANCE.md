# Governance

## Maintainers
Maintainers are responsible for project direction, releases, and security response. Until a maintainer list is published, the repository owners act as maintainers.

Contact for governance matters: use the emails listed in `SECURITY.md`.

## Decision making
- Day-to-day decisions are made by maintainers.
- Significant design decisions require an ADR in `docs/adr/`.
- If consensus cannot be reached, maintainers make the final decision.

## Becoming a maintainer
A contributor may be invited to become a maintainer after:
- A sustained history of high-quality contributions
- Demonstrated reliability in reviews and follow-through
- Agreement by existing maintainers

## Removing or stepping down
Maintainers may step down at any time. If a maintainer is inactive for an extended period (for example, 3 months without activity), the remaining maintainers may reassign responsibilities.

## Changes to governance
Changes to this document require approval from the maintainers.
